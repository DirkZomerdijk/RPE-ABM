# The Influence of Confirmation Bias and Social Influence on the Forming of Majority Opinions in social networks

The formation, spreading and exchange of opinions have been inten-sively simulated in the past using various models. Modelling opinion spreading can give insight into the dynamics of public opinion formation, but also into for example the survival ofminority opinions and the rise of extremism.  One commonly used classof  computational  models  for  the  simulation  of  opinion  dynamics  is  the agent-based model (ABM), in which each agent has an opinion that can be affected by other agents.   This paper presents an agent-based model that simulates the spreadingof two or more opinions.

## Getting Started

To run this model simply clone directory, and run Code/run.py.

### Installing

To run this model the following libraries are required

```
networkx
mesa 
heapq
matplotlib
random
itertools
operator
community
collections
numpy
copy
scipy
```

## Running the tests

Additional tests can be found in the Code/\*.pynb files.
Each file runs a experiment using mesa's BatchrunnerMP on 8 cores. And plots the obtained data.
